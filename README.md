# Hogwarts-Potions

**Topic:** A project about imaginary potion brewings via RESTful APIs, inspired by the novel named Harry Potter.

<br>

## What I have used during development:
- C#
- Entity Framework Core
- Code-first approach
- Postgre SQL database
- Object-oriented programming
- Asynchronous programming

<br>

## How to use:
1. Fork my repository (do not clone it!)
2. Create Postgre SQL **database** and **login role** on your machine, with following parameters:
    - Database name: hogwarts_potions_db
    - User name: ibardos_GitHub_demoProject
    - Password: Asd123
3. Copy my HTTP request collection from <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/collections/86ecfe19a612c45a3db3">here</a>
4. Import the collection as raw text into <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a>
5. Open the project solution in your IDE
6. Start the server in your IDE
7. Test the API endpoints with the predefined HTTP requests in Postman
8. Be happy

## Hints:
- You can create a Postgre SQL database in your terminal, but I recommend to use <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/download/">"pgAdmin 4"</a> if you prefer to use a GUI.
- If you don't understand anything, Google it, or feel free to contact me.
